// #About QuickEngine Graphics Study  //
////////////////////////////////////////

**QuickEngine Graphics Study** is a student project created for learning purposes by Rogue-Gambler <https://github.com/Rogue-Gambler>. The intention of this project is to further development and knowledge in C++, directX 11, and the fundamentals of computer graphics. Documentation about the updates and resources that help establish or even inspire this codebase will be found in their respective .txt files located in the *DOCUMENTATION* file.

This project was created using the Visual C++ template *Direct3D Win32 Game* following the basic game loop setup provided by: <https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTK/wiki/The-basic-game-loop>.

Special mention and thanks to my family and friends. A lot of people in academic discords are also all greatly appreciated for the time and patience spent responding to my questions.
