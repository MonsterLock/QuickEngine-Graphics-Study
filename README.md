// #About QuickEngine Graphics Study  //
////////////////////////////////////////

**QuickEngine Graphics Study** is a student project created for learning purposes by [Rogue-Gambler](https://github.com/Rogue-Gambler). The intention of this project is to further development and knowledge in:
- C++
- directX 11
- fundamentals of computer graphics.

Documentation:
- Updates (Coming soon)
- [Resources](DOCUMENTATION/RESOURCES.md) that help establish or even inspire this codebase

This project was created using the Visual C++ template `Direct3D Win32 Game` following [the basic game loop setup tutorial](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTK/wiki/The-basic-game-loop)

Special mention and thanks to my family and friends. A lot of people in academic discords are also all greatly appreciated for the time and patience spent responding to my questions.
